    description: `The building was designated as the Parliament of Sri Lanka in 1977. Initially, the building was home to the Legislative Council of Ceylon and was witness to the country’s transition from a colonial state to self-rule in 1947. Completed in 1930, this building was home to the country’s legislature for 53 years until the new parliamentary complex was opened at Sri Jayawardenepura in 1983 CE during the country’s prolonged Civil War. Since then, the Old Parliament Building has functioned as the home to the Presidential Secretariat.

Built in the Neo-Baroque style of architecture, the Old Parliament Building is a complete reminder of the Colonial past of Sri Lanka. It was built on an idea of Sir Henry McCallum. Designed by A. Woodson, the building was declared open as the Legislative Council on 29th January 1930 by Governor Sir Herbert Stanley.

The architecture of the Old Parliament Building in Sri Lanka is stunning. The facade of this magnificent building has an entrance reached by ascending many flights of steps. The British Coat of Arms adorned the top of the building face till 1948 when it was replaced by the arms of the Dominion of Ceylon and later by the arms of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.`
